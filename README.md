## server

* .net (c#) 
* realtime (signalr)
* storage agnostic (no sql, t-sql, flat file, in-memory)
* asp.net identity
* optional schema

## client

* angularjs, requirejs
* bower, npm, (? grunt / gulp)
* stylus (for now; maybe)
* karma / jasmine
* responsive
* available offlne

## why?
Wordpress makes me ill; I want to use Ghost, but:

* I prefer writing c# for my server
* I don't agree with some of ember's opinion's

But this is a framework.  A semi opinionated one.  I'm going to write a few modules for it:

* realtime chat / collaboration (think slack)
* a replacement for my blog

No matter what, I want something single page, (blog) optimized for search, modular, and integrated. 
That I can write cross platform clients for, at the very least in html.
